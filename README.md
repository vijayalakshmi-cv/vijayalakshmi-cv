## About me
- Ph.D. researcher (School of Electronics Engineering, VIT Chennai) working on real-world underwater vision for aquaculture monitoring and deep-sea imagery.
- Build end-to-end deep learning systems: **dataset curation → model design → benchmarking → evaluation → deployment-ready considerations**.
- Interests: robust vision under challenging conditions (turbidity/haze, low contrast, occlusion, illumination variation) and efficient models.

## Featured projects
### 1) Automated Fish Detection & Morphometric Analysis in Underwater Pond Aquaculture (PhD)
- DePondFi’23/DePondFi’24 datasets (pond environments with turbidity/occlusion/illumination variation)
- AquaYOLO + AquaYOLO-PoseCA (efficient detection + Coordinate Attention keypoint localisation)
- Calibration-driven reconstruction for **real-world fish length estimation**

### 2) A New Framework for Object Recognition in Underwater Imagery (NIOT)
- **NodYOLO-GAM**: YOLO backbone + **Global Attention Mechanism (GAM)** + multi-scale fusion (upsampling + SPPF)
- Introduced **NoD-Sea** dataset for benchmarking low-resolution underwater RGB imagery
- Targeted real-time deployment relevance for ocean technology/AUV settings

### 3) Medical & Aquatic Image Analytics (Classification + Explainability)
- Image-based classification for fish disease screening and medical image processing (MRI, CT, and chest radiographs)
- Benchmarking against standard deep backbones (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet, MobileNet) with reproducible evaluation
- ML workflows using Python/R, including feature engineering, model comparison, and explainable AI (e.g., saliency/Grad-CAM/SHAP-style interpretations)
